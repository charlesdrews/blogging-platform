blogging-platform
=================

This project is a blogging platform created for a school assignment. It was written in Python using the webapp2 framework and Jinja2 templates, and was deployed on Google App Engine. I received a grade of "A" for this assignment.

The finished application is located at [charlesdrews-blog.appspot.com](http://charlesdrews-blog.appspot.com/). Please feel free to create your own blog there and test out the platform.

Please see ***Documentation.pdf*** for a detailed description of the project's features and how they meet the assignment's requirements.
